Our project is a password manager built on the Algorand blockchain platform. The password manager utilizes the security and transparency of the blockchain technology to ensure that our clients' passwords are encrypted and secure.

With our password manager, users can easily generate and store strong passwords for their various online accounts. The passwords are encrypted using the Algorand blockchain, which means that only the user can access their passwords, and even we as the service provider cannot access them.

Our password manager is easy to use and comes with a user-friendly interface that allows clients to store, organize and manage their passwords securely. In addition, the password manager has a backup and recovery feature that ensures that clients never lose their passwords.

By leveraging the decentralized nature of the Algorand blockchain, our password manager provides an extra layer of security that traditional password managers do not offer. This is because our platform ensures that no one, including us as the service provider, has access to clients' passwords.

Overall, our Algorand-based password manager offers a secure, reliable, and easy-to-use solution for individuals and businesses to manage their passwords.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


1. Sign up: The first step is to sign up for our password manager service. You can do this by visiting our website and filling out the registration form. Once you have signed up, you will receive a confirmation email with your login details.
2. Log in: Use the login details provided to log in to your password manager account. Once you are logged in, you can start adding passwords to your account.
3. Add passwords: To add a password, fill in the details of the password, including the website or application name, the username, and the password itself. Click "Save Password" to store the password.
4. Access passwords: To access your passwords, click on the "Show Passwords" button. You can view all your saved passwords in a list.

### Prerequisites and Installation

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Make sure you have Docker Desktop install up and running! Also make sure your system ports 4001, 3000 and 6060 are not already in use.

* Set up sandbox:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/algorand/sandbox.git
  cd sandbox
  ./sandbox up testnet
  ```
  
* Clone the repository and then go to the root folder:
  ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/ayushgml/AlgoSafe.git
     cd AlgoSafe
  ```
  
* Run backend:
  ```sh
     cd backend
     npm i
     npm start
  ```
  
* Now backend would be running on localhost and port 6060
  
* Run frontend:
  ```sh
     cd frontend/algosafe-client
     npm i
     npm start
  ```
  
* Now frontend would be running on localhost and port 3000
